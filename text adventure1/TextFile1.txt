to do list:
1. make skeleton with clases and a basic setup, (clases, choices, basic mechanics.);
2. trouble shoot the basic setup and get it working.
3. get outside input to expand ideas and possibly discover things you havent thought of.
4. expand possible choises and increase possible outcomes of the story. 



checklist of subject topics to incorporate and use thru the project: 	- Objektorientering.
	- Klasser -
	- Logikk 
	- Innkapsling [public, private]
	- Interface. public entrace / private 
	- Arv 
	- Default value, overload. stats  and resistances. 

	ideas for extra features:
	- a dice roll feature to determine outcome of choices, 
	- a fail possibility
	- let the player chose a past for the character (the choise of past displays one of 3 prologues.)
	- make something for the entrance to the cave (abandoned shack by the side of a mountain or something.)
	- maybe make a choice scenario before finding the cave. maybe bandits apear and you need a place to hide or some other problem that leads you into the cave.

	dice roll feature : 
	public int RandomNumber(int maxNumber){
int rand = newRandom();
int number = rand.Next(0, maxNumber);
return number;
}
